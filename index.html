          Announced on September 7, the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max are
          Apple's new high-end flagship smartphones, being sold alongside the
          lower-cost iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. The iPhone 14 Pro models are
          much more feature rich than the iPhone 14 models, offering camera
          technology improvements, better display capabilities, a faster A16
          chip, and more. The 6.1 and 6.7-inch iPhone 14 Pro models look like
          the iPhone 13 Pro models with flat edges, stainless steel enclosure, a
          textured matte glass back, IP68 water resistance, and a Ceramic
          Shield-protected display, but the camera bumps are larger to
          accommodate new lenses, and the display has also changed. There is no
          longer a notch for the TrueDepth camera system, with Apple instead
          adopting what it calls the Dynamic Island, a pill-shaped cutout at the
          front of the display that houses camera equipment and can change in
          shape and size using software depending on what's on the screen. Apple
          says the Dynamic Island is meant to blend the line between hardware
          and software. It is able to adapt in real time, showing alerts,
          notifications, and activities in the space where the notch used to be.
          There is still hardware under there, but the TrueDepth camera takes up
          less space and the Dynamic Island makes it blend into the background
          by taking better advantage of the screen. The Dynamic Island can show
          payment confirmations with Face ID, Maps directions, phone calls,
          music information, Live Activities like sports scores, timers, and
          more, plus it can be interacted with using a tap and hold gesture.

          The MacBook Air M2 feels truly worthy of the Air name. And I’m not
          saying that the previous MacBook Air M1 wasn’t good — it helped
          introduce the world to the power of Apple silicon. It’s just that
          cramming revolutionary performance in the same old chassis didn’t feel
          (or look) like a leap forward to me. The new MacBook Air (from $1,199,
          tested at $1,899) is a breath of fresh you-know-what, and that’s
          because Apple paired an even faster M2 chip with a design that’s
          markedly thinner and lighter. Carrying this 2.7-pound notebook around
          and using it, this is a laptop that reminds me of the iconic original
          Air that Steve Jobs pulled out of a manilla envelope 14 years ago.
          Something this light can’t be that powerful — can it? Yes it can. As
          you’ll see in my full MacBook Air M2 review, the new Air has an
          unbeatable combination of portability, performance, display quality
          and overall comfort. Its over 14 hours of battery life in our testing
          is also very impressive. In fact, despite a few drawbacks, I’d argue
          this is the best laptop overall for the money -- and one of the the
          best MacBooks for college students if you can afford it.

          Apple's AirPods Pro 2 could well be one of the stars of the Apple
          September Event that's now confirmed for September 7. The iPhone 14
          range will grab all the headlines, of course, but there's a growing
          sense of excitement in the audio world about the possible arrival of a
          next-gen AirPods Pro. That's understandable, because the five-star
          rated AirPods Pro continue to rank among the very best wireless
          earbuds — and based on the rumors at least, the new model should be
          even better.
